# Quick Start Guide - X Post Deletion Script

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open X (Twitter)**
   - Go to `https://twitter.com` or `https://x.com`
   - Log into your account
   - Navigate to your profile

2. **Open Developer Tools**
   - **Windows/Linux:** Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`
   - **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Option + I`
   - Or right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect"

3. **Open the Console**
   - Click the "Console" tab in Developer Tools
   - Look for any red error messages and clear the console (click the ðŸš« icon or press `Ctrl + L`)

4. **Edit the Script**
   - Find the line: `const USERNAME = '@bradbarrish';`
   - Replace `@bradbarrish` with your X username (keep the `@` symbol)

5. **Run the Script**
   - Copy the entire script
   - Paste it into the console
   - Press Enter
   - The script will start running and you'll see progress messages in the console

## Monitoring Progress

- Watch the console for messages like:
  ```
  Starting post deletion process...
  Menu clicked successfully
  Delete option found
  Successfully deleted post
  ```
- Let the browser window remain active
- Don't close the Developer Tools window

## Stopping the Script

- To stop the script at any time:
  - Refresh the page, or
  - Close the browser tab, or
  - Type `location.reload()` in the console

## Common Issues

- If you see "Rate limit" messages, the script is working normally - just let it continue
- If the script stops, simply refresh the page and run it again
- Make sure you're on your profile page before starting

> **Note:** Keep the browser tab active and visible while the script runs. Minimizing or switching tabs might pause the script.

## Configuration

### Username Setting

To use the script, you need to set your X username in the configuration section. Find this line near the top of the script:

```javascript
const USERNAME = '@yourusername';  // Change this to your X username
```

Change `@yourusername` to your X username, making sure to keep the `@` symbol.

### Other Configurable Settings

The script includes several timing configurations that can be adjusted if needed:

```javascript
const CLICK_DELAY = 3000;        // Delay between clicks (3 seconds)
const RETRY_DELAY = 4000;        // Delay before retrying failed attempts (4 seconds)
const MENU_DELAY = 2000;         // Delay after clicking repost menu (2 seconds)
const SCROLL_DELAY = 2000;       // Delay after scrolling (2 seconds)
const RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 5000;   // Delay when hitting rate limits (5 seconds)
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;           // Maximum number of retry attempts
```

You can adjust these values if you're experiencing issues:
- Increase delays if actions are failing
- Decrease delays if the script is running too slowly
- Increase MAX_RETRIES if you want more retry attempts

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to your X profile
2. Open the browser's Developer Tools (F12 or Right-click > Inspect)
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Paste the entire script into the console
5. Press Enter to run

The script will:
1. Start processing visible posts
2. Automatically scroll to load more content
3. Handle both regular posts and reposts appropriately
4. Process replies when in the replies section

## Console Output

The script provides detailed console logging to help you monitor its progress:

- `Starting post deletion process...` - Script has started
- `Scrolling to load more posts...` - Loading new content
- `Menu clicked successfully` - Found and clicked a post's menu
- `Delete option found` or `Repost detected` - Type of post identified
- `Successfully deleted post` - Post was successfully removed
- Various error messages if issues occur

## Error Handling

The script includes several safety features:

- Retries failed operations up to 3 times
- Waits during rate limiting
- Verifies elements are visible before clicking
- Provides detailed error messages in the console

## Known Limitations

1. Browser must remain active while the script runs
2. May need to refresh the page if X's interface becomes unresponsive
3. Rate limiting by X may slow down the deletion process
4. Script needs to be rerun if the page is refreshed

## Troubleshooting

### Rate Limiting
- The script will automatically handle rate limits
- You'll see "Waiting for rate limit cooldown..." in the console
- No action needed; it will continue automatically

### Failed Deletions
- The script will retry automatically up to 3 times
- If still failing, try refreshing the page and running again

### Slow Performance
- Check your internet connection
- Try increasing the delay values in the configuration
- Refresh the page if X becomes unresponsive

### Script Stops
- Check console for error messages
- Refresh the page and run the script again
- Make sure you're logged into X

## Safety Features

The script includes several safety measures:

- Only processes posts in visible areas
- Verifies post ownership before deletion
- Handles repost undoing separately from deletion
- Includes rate limit management
- Provides clear console logging for monitoring

## Updates and Maintenance

Since X's interface may change over time, you might need to update selectors or handling logic. Key areas that might need updates:

- Button selectors (data-testid attributes)
- Menu item text
- Interface element structure

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify your username is correctly set
3. Ensure you're logged into X
4. Try refreshing the page and rerunning the script

> **Important:** Always keep a backup of any important posts before running mass deletion scripts.
