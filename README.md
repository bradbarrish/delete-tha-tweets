## What is this?
This is a simple and safe script that can be run in your browser console to automate the deletion of your tweets on Twitter (I still can't bring myself to call them 'posts' or to refer to the hell site as anything other than Twitter).

## Why did I do this?
I had been using a service to automatically delete my tweets at a specific interval, but because of changes to API access, the service hasn't been working for some time. 

## Will you be adding any other features?
Probably not, but feel free to improve upon it.
